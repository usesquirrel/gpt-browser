cd gpt-browser
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys
```

4. Run development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Key Areas for Contribution

#### 1. Image Providers
Add support for new image generation models:
- Create a new provider class extending `ImageProvider`
- Implement `generate()` and `generateStream()` methods
- Register in `ImageProviderFactory`

#### 2. Caching Improvements
- Add support for different storage backends
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
- Add cache statistics and management UI

#### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Reduce token usage in prompts
- Optimize HTML cleaning algorithms
- Improve streaming performance

#### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- Add dark mode support
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add more loading states and animations

#### 5. New Features
- Batch URL processing
- Export functionality (PDF, PNG)
- Browser history
- Bookmarking system

## Code Style Guide

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types, avoid `any` when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Document complex types

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
- Handle loading and error states

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and colors
- Use CSS variables for themes

### Best Practices
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add loading states for async operations
- Log important operations for debugging
- Consider cost implications (AI tokens)
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

Currently, the project doesn't have a test suite. Contributions to add testing are highly welcome:

- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI
- E2E tests for critical flows

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for DALL-E 3 image generation
fix: resolve timeout issue on Vercel deployment
docs: update README with troubleshooting section
```

## API Design Guidelines

When adding new endpoints:

1. **Follow RESTful conventions** where applicable
2. **Support streaming** for long-running operations
3. **Include proper error handling** with meaningful messages
4. **Add request validation** using Zod or similar
5. **Document the endpoint** in README
6. **Consider rate limiting** for expensive operations

## Performance Considerations

- **Token Usage**: Minimize prompts while maintaining quality
- **Caching**: Cache expensive operations aggressively
- **Streaming**: Use SSE for real-time updates
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Implement retry logic with backoff

## Security Guidelines

- **Never commit secrets** to the repository
- **Validate all user input** before processing
- **Sanitize URLs** before fetching
- **Implement rate limiting** for public deployments
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive config
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web security
